# Guitar fretboard visualiser

### Don't fancy mastering 'CAGED'? 
###Use this handy-dandy interactive tool instead

Given a 'scale name' and 'relative key' (major/minor) a visual interpretation of a guitar fretboard is displayed which shows you all the notes which are legitimate to play in the specified scale
