#Guitar fretboard visualiser

###Don't fancy mastering 'CAGED'? Use this handy-dandy interactive tool instead

Given a 'scale name' and 'relative key' (major/minor) a visual interpretation of a guitar fretboard is displayed which shows you all the notes which are legitimate to play in the specified scale

Currently a beta build, more functionality to come in the future (user-implemented custom scale intervals, change amount of frets, more/less strings(?))

**Languages:** Python *with GUI facilitated by TKinter*
