### Functional
- [ ] Add octave identity to note constructor
- [ ] Give octave information to the 'String()' constructor such that it can label each note with it's corresponding octave
- [ ] Display octave identity along with each note on fretboard
- [ ] Add audio library such that each displayed fretboard note can be clicked to play it's corresponding tone
- [ ] Implement standardised way to store scale systems
- [ ] Implement 'scales', 'tuning' and 'music_notes' as document globals instead of inside of classes, or store inside of separate document to clean up code

### Aesthetic (GUI)
- [ ] Nest a PhotoImage widget behind the fretboard notes with a woodgrain effect
- [ ] If possible, find a way to remove bottom and top label borders only such that label borders look like fret bars
